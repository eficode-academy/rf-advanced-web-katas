# XPaths

## Learning Goals

- You know how to navigate XPaths
- You are aware of common pitfalls with XPaths

## Introduction

Ideally, web development and test automation goes hand in hand, so
that the people who develop the websites, would also do (at least
a bit of) test automation, or be aware of it. However, more often than not this is not
the case and that causes trouble for test automation developers.
Websites are often created with "UX first" approach, which is good for the users,
but it typically means more work for the test automation developers.

Nowadays, websites are created with modern frameworks, which generate
nice looking websites from templates. Pretty often developers
forget to add unique `id` attributes to elements, so we need
alternative locators for our elements.

This is where XPaths step in. Sure enough, there are other locator strategies
with SeleniumLibrary and Browser than XPaths and IDs (like CSS paths), but when using an XPath is the
only way to find both a functional and unique identifier for an element.

The trick to XPaths is to make a locator which is accurate enough to pinpoint
your element, but not too exact as to make it fragile, and thus fast to break unnecessarily.
If a website is likely to change, using bad XPath strategies is an easy way to find
ourself in a swamp of refactoring and debugging. A good mindset for XPaths
is to keep them short, but understandable. Shorter XPaths mean fewer places
for it to break and less time wasted on unnecessary debugging. If they do break,
as long as they still make sense, you can make replacement locators.

A few general tips for good XPath usage:

1. Don't use the browser's `Copy XPath` button. This will give you too
obscure, segmented and precise XPath. For example, Firefox's XPath for the
Bad Flask App's dropdown menu is `/html/body/section[1]/nav/div/a`, which is long,
has 6 strictly ordered parts of generic type, and uses no unique attributes. Any
changes to element types, the page's structure, or the order of those elements
will break the locator. Also, since all elements should be behind `/html/body`, good
XPaths should **always** simply start with `//` when testing websites, as the operator searches from anywhere in the HTML document.
2. Ensure your locator matches **exactly** 1 element. The first element that matches
to a given XPath is used even if there are multiple
matches found. In theory it's safe to use an XPath if your element is the first
element matched, but a small change in the website can change the order and cause
unexpected behaviour.
3. Always **test your locator** in the console before adding it to your test
case. You can `ctrl+F` in the `inspector` tab of the developer tools or you
can use the `console` tab to use basic JavaScript queries to get your XPath,
such as `$x("//path/to/my/element");`.
4. Use variables to store and use your XPaths in the tests. If one locator is used in many places, you
will need to fix it once, and you don't need to look for all occurences of hard-coded
values in your code. Additionally, the variable name can further clarify what
the XPath was pointing to, so it is easier to fix it when it stops pointing anywhere.

## Exercise

### Overview

- Close the dropdown _if it's opened_.
- Open the form.
  - Test should pass with or without the dropdown initially opened.
- **Optional:** Investigate what might happen if you don't close the dropdown beforehand.
What errors do you find?

### Step-by-step

  <summary>SeleniumLibrary</summary>

**Write keywords to close the dropdown if it's opened and to show our form
as our `Test Setup`.**

As we land on Bad Flask App, we _might_ see a huge dropdown opened
covering the whole website. It opens at random, so there's no knowing whether it
will open in our test case or not. While we're looking at the Bad Flask App, let's
open our developer console by right-clicking anywhere on the screen and selecting `inspect`.
It's a good idea to keep the developer console opened always when you're writing Selenium tests.
We notice, that the page's elements don't have `id` fields that would allow us to
easily access them.

Let's start by observing the page's elements and their attributes. We notice that the dropdown button is an
`a` element, which has classes we could use, for example `dropdown-toggle`. However, there's a hidden
element before in the HTML, so we can't use that `a` directly. Instead, we can use its parent
`div` element to handle the click. Also, it has a class called `open` when the dropdown is opened and it's
missing when it's closed. So, in other words _if_ the `div` element has a class called `open`, we should click it.

Still, the locator we got may sound a bit cryptic. Instead of adding it directly into our keyword, let's
make a variable in the resource file. Following Robot Framework's best practices, we should give our
variable a name that is in UPPER CASE. Similarly with all static, generic-sounding XPaths, we can continue
adding them into a table of `Variables`, all with meaningful names.

- Add `//div[contains(@class, 'open')]` into a variable with a meaningful name, such
as `OPENED DROPDOWN`.
- Create a keyword that clicks the `a` element under your variable.
- Create a conditional by using `Run Keyword And Return Status`, `Page Should Contain Element`,
and `Run Keyword If` to close your potentially opened dropdown.

**Open the form.**

Now we're able to close the dropdown if it's opened. We still need to show our form.
Again, we don't have an `id` for our element, but luckily the page has only one `button`,
so our XPath is fairly straightforward: `//button`. Again, even though our XPath is short,
it sounds too generic, so let's add it to our `Variables` table.

- Add a variable for our `//button` XPath.
- Create a keyword which clicks the `//button` element.

Now we have two new keywords: one that closes the dropdown if it is opened and one
that clicks the "Show Form" button. Let's add this to our `Test Setup`. We could
write a wrapper keyword that calls both our new keywords or we can use the `Run Keywords`
keyword from the BuiltIn library directly. Using `Run Keywords` is a way to group
keywords into a single step if needed. We can link different keywords with `AND` after
each keyword and its parameters.

- Add `Test Setup` to your `Settings` table and call both new keywords.

> It's possible that your line becomes quite long when you call multiple keywords.
> You can always split your keywords into multiple lines using `...` at the beginning
> of the next line.
>
> E.g.
>
> ```robot
> *** Settings ***
> Test Setup    Run Keywords
> ...           My First Keyword
> ...           AND
> ...           My Second Keyword
> ```

We can still validate our test behaves as expected by running `robot -d output tests/form.robot`.
Our test should open the browser to Bad Flask App, check if the dropdown is opened and close it
when possible, click the "Show Form" button, and finally close the browser.

### Possible Errors

#### `ElementClickInterceptedException`

If you don't close the dropdown you might get an error which says something like this:

```text
ElementClickInterceptedException: Message: element click intercepted: Element <button id="showForm" style="width: 100px; margin: -100 auto 20 auto;">...</button> is not clickable at point (120, 206). Other element would receive the click: <ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="dLabel">...</ul>
```

This means that you're trying to access an element that is _behind_ another element.
If you try to click the area where the element is, but another element is on top of it, that top
element will receive our click instead, just as if a human was interacting with it. This remains true even
if the top element is completely transparent.

This is common with hover tooltips or menus. Some fields are hidden
behind other elements and typically you need to close a menu or move your
cursor somewhere else to make the hover go away. For example, some forms
show helpful tooltips, but when a tooltip covers the "Submit" button,
your test execution will fail.
