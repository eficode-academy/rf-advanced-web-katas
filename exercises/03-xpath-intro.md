# XPaths

## Learning Goals

- You know how to navigate XPaths
- You are aware of common pitfalls with XPaths

## Introduction

Ideally, web development and test automation goes hand in hand, so
that the people who develop the websites, would also do (at least
a bit of) test automation, or be aware of it. However, frequently this is not
the case, and that causes trouble for test automation developers.

Nowadays, websites are often created with frameworks generating pretty frontend UIs from templates. This can be good for the manual users,
but it typically means more work for the test automation developers.
When developers generate code, they often
forget to add unique `id` attributes to elements, and tests need
alternative locators for finding elements.

Aside from `id`s, there are other locator strategies working with both SeleniumLibrary and Browser
like name attributes, class names, and CSS paths, but it can still happen that using an XPath is the
only way to find both a functional and unique identifier for an element.

The trick to XPaths is to make a locator which is accurate enough to pinpoint
your element, but not too exact as to make it fragile, and thus fast to break unnecessarily.
If a website is likely to change, using bad XPath strategies is an easy way to find
oneself in a swamp of refactoring and debugging. A good mindset for XPaths
is to keep them short, but understandable. XPaths composed of fewer segments mean fewer places
for it to break and less time wasted on unnecessary debugging. If they do break,
as long as they still make sense, you can make replacement locators.

A few general tips for good XPath usage:

1. Don't use the browser's `Copy XPath` button. This will give you too
obscure, segmented and precise XPath. For example, Firefox's XPath for the
Bad Flask App's dropdown menu is `/html/body/section[1]/nav/div/a`, which is long,
has 6 segments, all are of generic type, all directly related, and none have unique attributes. Any
changes to the element types, the page's structure, or the order of those elements
will break the locator. Also, since all elements should be behind `/html/body`, good
XPaths should **always** simply start with `//` when testing websites, as the operator searches from anywhere in the HTML document.
2. Ensure your locator matches **exactly** 1 element. The first element that matches
a given XPath is used even if there are multiple
matching XPaths. In theory, it's safe to use an XPath if your element is the first
element matched, but a small change in the website can change the order and cause
unexpected behaviour.
3. Remember to always **test your locator** in the console before adding it to your test
case. You can `ctrl+F` in the `inspector` tab of the developer tools, or you
can use the `console` tab to use basic JavaScript queries to get your XPath,
such as `$x("//path/to/my/element");`.
4. If you have same locators used in multiple places, store them in variables, and use variables in tests instead. When the locator breaks, you won't need to look for all occurrences of hard-coded values in your code. Additionally, the variable name can further clarify what
the XPath was pointing to, so it is easier to fix it when it stops working.

## Exercise

### Overview

- Implement the logic to close the dropdown _if it's opened_ as part of the test setup.
- Implement the keyword to open the form, also as part of the test setup.
  - Test should pass with or without the dropdown initially opened.
- **Optional:** Investigate what happens if you don't close the dropdown beforehand.
What errors do you see?

### Step-by-step

<br />

As we land on Bad Flask App, we _might_ see a huge dropdown opened
covering the whole website. It opens at random, so there's no knowing whether it
will open in our test case or not. While we're looking at the Bad Flask App, let's
open our developer console by right-clicking anywhere on the screen and selecting `inspect`.
It's a good idea to keep the developer console always opened when you're writing web tests.
We notice, that the dropdown doesn't have an `id` field that would allow us to
easily access that element.

Let's start by observing the page's elements and their attributes. We notice that the dropdown button is an
`a` element, which has classes we could use, for example `dropdown-toggle`. However, there's a similar, but hidden `a`
element before in the HTML, so we can't use that `a` alone. Instead, we can use its parent
`div` element to handle the click, as it is the size of the button. Also, it has a class called `open` when the dropdown is opened which disappears when it's closed. So, in other words _if_ the `div` element has a class called `open`, we can click it to close it.

Still, the locator we use may look a bit obscure. Instead of adding it directly into our keyword, let's
make a variable in the resource file. Following Robot Framework's best practices, we should give our
variable an UPPER CASE name. As we write more code, we can add next XPaths into the table of `Variables`, every time giving them meaningful names.

- Add `//div[contains(@class, 'open')]` into a variable with a meaningful name, such
as `OPENED DROPDOWN`.
- Implement the keyword called `Close Dropdown If Opened` that clicks the element `OPENED DROPDOWN`.

<details>
  <summary>SeleniumLibrary</summary>

To check if the element is visible we need to first get the element status, then combine that with
`Run Keyword If`. We can ge the element status with `Run Keyword And Return Status` combined with
`Page Should Contain Element`.

- Use `Run Keyword And Return Status` and `Page Should Contain Element` to check if the dropdown is opened.
Store the result in a variable.
- Using your new variable, use `Run Keyword If` to conditionally close the dropdown.

</details> <!-- SeleniumLibrary -->

<details>
  <summary>Browser</summary>

To check if the element is visible, we can use `Get Element State` and check the state for `visible`.

- Use `Get Element State` with `visible` as the state and store it in a variable.
- Using your new variable, use `Run Keyword If` to conditionally close the dropdown.

<details>
  <summary>Implement the keyword to open the form, also as part of the test setup.</summary>

<br />

Now we're able to close the dropdown if it's opened. We still need to show our form.
Again, we don't have an `id` for our element, but luckily the page has only one `button`,
so our XPath is fairly straightforward: `//button`. Again, even though our XPath is short,
it sounds too general, so better add it to the `Variables` table.

- Add a variable for our `//button` XPath.
- Implement the keyword called `Show Form` which clicks the `//button` element.

Now we have two new keywords: one that closes the dropdown if it is opened and one
that clicks the "Show Form" button. Let's add this to our `Test Setup`. We could
write a wrapper keyword that calls both our new keywords, or we can use the `Run Keywords`
keyword from the BuiltIn library directly. Using `Run Keywords` is a way to group
keywords into a single step if needed. We can link different keywords with `AND` after
each keyword and its parameters.

- Add `Test Setup` to your `Settings` table and call `Close Dropdown If Opened` and `Show Form`.

> It's possible that your line becomes quite long when you call multiple keywords.
> You can always split your keywords into multiple lines using `...` at the beginning
> of the next line.
>
> E.g.
>
> ```robot
> *** Settings ***
> Test Setup    Run Keywords
> ...           My First Keyword
> ...           AND
> ...           My Second Keyword
> ```

We can still validate our test behaves as expected by running `robot -d output tests/form.robot`.
Our test should open the browser to Bad Flask App, check if the dropdown is opened and close it
when possible, click the "Show Form" button, and finally close the browser.

### Possible Errors

#### `ElementClickInterceptedException`

If you don't close the dropdown you might get an error which says something like this:

```text
ElementClickInterceptedException: Message: element click intercepted: Element <button id="showForm" style="width: 100px; margin: -100 auto 20 auto;">...</button> is not clickable at point (120, 206). Other element would receive the click: <ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="dLabel">...</ul>
```

This means that you're trying to access an element that is _behind_ another element.
If you try to click the area where the element is, but another element is on top of it, that top
element will receive our click instead, just as if a human was interacting with it. This occurs even
if the top element is completely transparent.

This is common with hover tooltips or menus. Some fields are hidden
behind other elements, and typically you need to close a menu or move your
cursor somewhere else to make the hover go away. For example, some forms
show helpful tooltips, but when a tooltip covers the "Submit" button,
your test execution will fail.
