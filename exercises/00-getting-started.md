# Getting Started

Welcome to Robot Framework advanced training!

This material assumes you have some basic knowledge of Robot Framework, and automated acceptance testing.

This training has 2 corresponding halves: RESTinstance + SeleniumLibrary, and Browser.
Both halves use the same exercise files.

Both halves are further divided into 2 parts: REST API and UI.
In the first part (file 01), we're going to write tests that use REST API against a mock-up
interface. The exercises in this portion can be done in any order. In the second part (files 02-09),
we're going to make a little deep-dive into web UI testing and learn how to handle multiple different errors
and how to avoid common pitfalls. _The second portion should be done in order_ as each next
exercise depends on the previous one.

All tests are written for the Bad Flask App.
It is a Python [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) application,
intentionally implemented poorly from a test automation point of view. The UI contains commonly used
elements that test automation developers struggle with when they write tests.

## Prerequisites

You should already have Python 3 with pip, and Robot Framework 5 installed.
As of writing this documentation Robot Framework 5.0.1 is the latest 
version that works with all the following libraries.
You can use Python's virtual environments.

To find suitable keywords fast, keep open the official reference pages for

- [BuiltIn](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html)
- [DateTime](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/DateTime.html)

And either

- [SeleniumLibrary](https://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html)
- [RESTInstance](https://asyrjasalo.github.io/RESTinstance/)

or

- [Browser](https://marketsquare.github.io/robotframework-browser/Browser.html)

### Installing Prerequisites

#### SeleniumLibrary

In case you don't have SeleniumLibrary and RESTinstance libraries installed, run the
following commands on the command line in your environment:

- `pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary`
- `pip install restinstance`

In order to run tests for browsers, you need a driver for that browser in order for Selenium
to gain access to it. Check your *browser version* and download a *corresponding webdriver version* for it from
[here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) (for Chrome) or
[here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) (for Firefox). Other browsers are supported,
but using Chrome or Firefox is recommended.

The driver needs to be placed in your `PATH`. One easy way to do it is to copy the driver you just
downloaded into the same directory where your Python installation is.

- Run `which python3` to show the location of you Python installation.
- Run `cp /path/to/your/chromedriver /path/to/your/bin`.

#### Browser

In case you don't have Browser library installed, see the [official installation instructions](https://github.com/MarketSquare/robotframework-browser#installation-instructions).

### Start Your Server (pick one)

Regardless of how you start it, the Bad Flask App should offer a web interface running at `localhost:5000`.
Open your browser to check that you can see the website running correctly.

If you're running Docker and you can't access `localhost:5000`, then your Docker machine
is probably not connected to localhost. In this case you run `docker inspect <container name>`
to find out the IP address of your container, and connect to port `5000` using that IP address.

When running it as a Docker container, keep in mind you will need to spin the container down after the training, or it will stay up and use your resources.

#### By using image from Dockerhub

Running the Docker image from Docker Hub. This is the only available
method if you don't want to clone the repository.

`$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 pleksi/bad-flask-app`

#### By using docker-compose in this repository

`$ docker-compose up -d`

#### By Building the Docker image manually

```bash
$ docker build -t bad-flask-app bad-flask-app
...
$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 bad-flask-app
```

#### By running the Flask app without Docker

```bash
$ pip3 install -r bad-flask-app/requirements.txt
...
$ python3 bad-flask-app/app.py
```

Started like this, the app will not daemonize like in previous examples,
so you need to open a new terminal to run your tests.

## Open Exercises Directory

The repo has a directory called `exercises`. All required files are pre-created into the repo
with all necessary tables. Your task is to fill these files during the exercises.

## Running Your Tests

At any time during the training, you can run your tests with `robot -d output tests` (assuming
that you're inside `exercises` directory). You can also add a `-i <tag>` to run only a specific test.
If you don't want new test run results overwriting previous ones, use `-T` to add timestamps to file names.

E.g

```bash
robot -d output tests
robot -d output tests/form.robot
robot -d output -i rest tests
robot -d output -i ui tests/form.robot
robot -T -d output tests
```
